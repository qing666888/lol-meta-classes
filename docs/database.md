## Database file format (db/database.py)

### Purpose
- **What it is**: A stable, diff-friendly, Python-like text representation of the LoL meta schema (classes, inheritance, and properties) generated from a meta JSON dump.
- **What it is not**: Valid/executable Python. It is intentionally a simple text format that looks like Python so it’s easy to read and diff in Git.

### How it’s generated
- Via `scripts/db_import.py`, which:
  - Loads the latest (or provided) `dumps/*.json` and normalizes old/new meta formats.
  - Resolves known type and field hashes using `hashes/hashes.bintypes.txt` and `hashes/hashes.binfields.txt`.
  - Merges classes, bases, and fields into a persistent database and writes `db/database.py` deterministically.
- CI: The `Sync LoL Meta Classes` workflow regenerates and commits `db/database.py` when `dumps/` changes.

### File structure
- Header line: `#!python` (for editor hinting only).
- For each class:
  - Class line: `class <TypeName>(<Base1, Base2, ...>):`
    - `<TypeName>` is the resolved type name if known, otherwise the raw hex hash (e.g. `0xe75aad84`).
    - Base list contains the resolved primary base and any secondary bases (if any). - inheritance
  - Field lines (indented 4 spaces):
    - `FieldName: (ft, kt, vt, kh)`
      - **FieldName**: resolved field name if known, otherwise the raw hex hash.
      - **ft** (field type): one of scalar or composite types, e.g. `Bool`, `I32`, `U32`, `F32`, `String`, `Hash`, `File`, `Flag`, or composite types `List`, `List2`, `Pointer`, `Embed`, `Link`, `Option`, `Map`.
      - **kt** and **vt** (auxiliary type parameters):
        - For `List`/`List2`/`Option` (container): `kt` is the fixed-size as hex (e.g. `0x0` if dynamic); `vt` is the container value type (e.g. `U32`).
        - For `Map`: `kt` is the map key type (e.g. `String`); `vt` is the map value type (e.g. `U32`).
        - For scalars and non-container composites: both are `0x0`.
      - **kh** (other-class/type reference):
        - For `Pointer`/`Embed`/`Link` and some composites, this is the referenced class. It is resolved to a known type name when available; otherwise it remains the raw hex hash. For non-referential types it is `0x0`.
  - Terminator: `pass`

Example:
```text
class ExampleClass(BaseType):
    ExampleList: (List2, 0x0, U32, 0x0)
    PointerToOther: (Pointer, 0x0, 0x0, OtherType)
    NameToCount: (Map, String, U32, 0x0)
    ScalarValue: (I32, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)
    pass
```

### Name resolution and unknowns
- Type and field hashes are mapped using the files in `hashes/`.
- If a hash is unknown, it is left as its raw hex form in the output (no prefixing). This applies to both class names and field names, and to the `kh` referenced type.

### Ordering
- Classes are written in ascending order by their class hash (hex string key).
- Each class’s `bases` are sorted before printing.
- Each class’s `fields` are sorted before printing. The tuple `(ft, kt, vt, kh)` is included in sorting, so ordering is stable for identical inputs.

### How merging works
- Running `db_import.py` repeatedly merges in additional classes/fields from new dumps into the existing `db/database.py` representation.
- Duplicate classes/fields are de-duplicated; conflicts (e.g., same field with different type tuple) will raise errors during import.

### Regeneration (manual)
```bash
python3 scripts/db_import.py db/database.py dumps/<version>.json
git diff -- db/database.py | cat
```

### Why this format
- Readable, compact, and Git-diff–friendly.
- Strictly line-oriented and regex-parseable (`db_import.py` uses regex to read it back), so it’s easy to review and stable across runs.
