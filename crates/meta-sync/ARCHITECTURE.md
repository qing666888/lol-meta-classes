# meta-sync Architecture

## Overview

`meta-sync` is an automated tool that synchronizes League of Legends metaclass information across game versions. It fetches version manifests from GitHub, downloads game binaries, and extracts metaclass definitions.

## Workflow

```
GitHub API → Version Discovery → Manifest Download → Binary Extraction → Dumper Execution → JSON Output
```

### Step-by-step Process

1. **Version Discovery** (`github.rs`)

   - Queries `Morilli/riot-manifests` GitHub repository
   - Looks for `LoL/EUW1/macos/lol-game-client/*.txt` files
   - Each file represents a game version (e.g., `15.1.123456.txt`)
   - Sorts versions using semantic versioning
   - Filters out versions below cutoff (13.14.5227601)

2. **Manifest Processing** (`manifest.rs`)

   - Downloads version manifest URL from GitHub file content
   - Fetches RMAN (Riot Manifest) file from CDN
   - Parses RMAN to find the `LeagueofLegends` macOS binary
   - Downloads binary chunks and reconstructs the file

3. **Binary Analysis** (`dumper.rs`)

   - Executes the `dumper` tool on the downloaded binary
   - Dumper uses pattern matching to find metaclass vector in binary
   - Extracts class definitions, inheritance, and field types
   - Outputs structured JSON to `dumps/{version}.json`

4. **Output Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "15.1.123456",
     "classes": [
       {
         "hash": "0x12345678",
         "name": "Champion",
         "bases": ["0xabcdef12"],
         "fields": [...]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why macOS binaries?

- macOS binaries use Mach-O format which is easier to parse
- The dumper tool has mature Mach-O support
- Metaclass information is identical across platforms

### Version Cutoff

- Versions ≤ 13.14.5227601 use a legacy format
- These require different parsing logic not yet implemented
- Cutoff prevents processing incompatible versions

### Caching Strategy

- Checks if `dumps/{version}.json` exists before processing
- Skips already-processed versions
- No cleanup of old versions (manual maintenance)

### Error Recovery

- Network errors are reported but don't stop processing
- Failed versions are logged and skipped
- Temp files are cleaned up on success
